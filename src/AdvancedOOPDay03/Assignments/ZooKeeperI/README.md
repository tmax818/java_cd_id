## checklist

- [ ] Create a `Mammal` class that has an `energyLevel` member variable and `displayEnergy()` method. The `displayEnergy()` method should show the animal's energy level as well as return it.

- [ ] Create a separate class `Gorilla` that can `throwSomething()`, `eatBananas()`, and `climb()`

- [ ] For the `throwSomething()` method, have it print out a message indicating that the gorilla has thrown something, as well as decrease the energy level by 5

- [ ] For the `eatBananas()` method, have it print out a message indicating the gorilla's satisfaction and increase its energy by 10

- [ ] For the `climb()` method, have it print out a message indicating the gorilla has climbed a tree and decrease its energy by 10

- [ ] Create a `GorillaTest` class to instantiate a gorilla and have it throw three things, eat bananas twice, and climb once.
